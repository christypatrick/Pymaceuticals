# Pymaceuticals

### Summary:  
In a recent study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

### Observations:

* The correlation coefficient (r) for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is calculated at .84. This indicates a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. The r-squared for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is calculated at 0.7088. This indicates that approximately 71% if the observed variation can be explained by the modelâ€™s inputs. In the linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, we can see the slope of the line is .95. For each additional gram in mouse weight, we can expect the average tumor volume to increase by .95 mm3.
* The Ramicane and Capomulin drug regimens resulted in the lowest final tumor volume compared to the Infubinol and Ceftamin drug regimens. Infubinol is the only drug of the four that have outliers.
* Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimens had the highest number of mice throughout the course of the study (230 and 228 respectively). This indicates that more mice made it to the final timepoints compared to the other treatment regimens.
